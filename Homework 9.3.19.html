Software Engineer Homework
</h1>

<p>
<ul><li>Mayuko expressed that "soft skills" and collaborative skills are as important or more important as technical skills.</li>
<ul><li>I think this is reflected throughout the syllabus (specifically in the "Pair up" and "General Rules for Giving/Getting Help" sections) as there is a constant emphasis on working with peers and giving and receiving feedback as valuable skills.</li>
<li>The "Pair up" section also mentions that even when working with others is frustrating (as Mayuko mentions is possible in a career), <q>helping your partner will deepen your understanding as well as make you a better communicator.</q></ul></li></ul>
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>It was comforting to here that you can be authentically you and be a successful software engineer.</li> 
<ul><li>It was also comforting to hear that you don't need an extensive background in computer science before college to do well in computer science.</li>
<li>This tied in to when Dr. B said he doesn't expect the reading to <i>"instantly make you an expert in the field"</i> on the syllabus in the prep work section.</ul></li></ul>
