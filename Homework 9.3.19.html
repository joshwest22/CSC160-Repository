Software Engineer Homework

<ul><li>Mayuko expressed that "soft skills" and collaborative skills are as important or more important as technical skills. <li>I think this is reflected throughout the syllabus (specifically in the "Pair up" and "General Rules for Giving/Getting Help" sections) as there is a constant emphasis on working with peers and giving and receiving feedback.</li></li>

It was comforting to here that you can be authentically you and be a successful software engineer. It was also comforting to hear that you don't need an extensive background in computer science before college to do well in computer science. This tied in to when Dr. B said he doesn't expect the reading to <i>"instantly make you an expert in the field"</i> on the syllabus in the prep work section.
